# 101 Ways to Animate Things

I tend to forget that there's a million ways to animate things. Here's some ways. This will probably be a mish-mash of technical methods as well as things that can actually be done.

Also worth noting: I use Firefox full time, and I'm not cross-browser-compatibility-testing anything here. This is mostly for the sake of reference. Maybe I'll go back through and add cross-browser usage notes, where applicable. Or not.

This is also, like some of my [graphics experiments](https://chickenwing-gingerbreadman.xyz/graphics/), sort of a rough sketchbook of ideas. So there's themes and variations and it's sometimes in a logical order but the list might also swerve from time to time when I jump topics or ideas or libraries or whatever. Not to be treated as an exhaustive tutorial.

## Using Fractal

I'm using [Fractal](https://fractal.build/) to organize this. 

To run this locally:

* npm install
* npm run dev

I'm using some bash scripts to create new samples and such. I dunno. It seems to be working for me. I'm on MacOS. It probably falls down anywhere else.
